# 1.0.11
* Patched the caching bug that prevents 1.0.x from resolving the same
path with different methods.

# 1.0.10
* Closed [#162](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/162), fixing a caching bug
that would cause multiple requests to the same URL to fail.
* Resolved dependency injection of primitives (namely `String`), no longer triggering
errors about `String has no constructor`, etc.

# 1.0.9
* Closed [#161](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/161). `addCreated`/`addUpdatedAt` no longer
crash when `serialize` is `false`.
* Added an explicit on `charcode`, `path`, and others. Resolves
[#160](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/160).
* `ResponseContext` now implements `StreamSink<List<int>`, so data can be streamed directly to the
underlying response.
* You can now inject `encoders` into a `ResponseContext`, which takes care of `Accept-Encoding`.
This will ultimately replace `package:angel_compress`.
Resolves [#159](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/159).

# 1.0.8
* Changed `req.query` to use a modifiable Map if the body has not parsed. Resolves
[#157](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/157).
* Changed all constants to `camelCase`, and deprecated their `CONSTANT_CASE` counterparts. Resolves
[#155](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/155).
* Resolved [#156](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/156) by adding a `graphql` provider.
* Added an `analysis-options.yaml` enabling strong mode. Preparing for Dart 2.0.
* Added a dependency on `package:meta`, resolving [#154](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/154),
and added corresponding annotations to make extending Angel easier.
* Resolved [#158](https://github.com/angel-dart/framework/issues/158) by using proper `StreamController`
patterns, to prevent memory leaks.
* Route handler sequences are now cached in a Map, so repeat requests will be resolved faster.
* A message is no longer printed in production mode.
* Removed the inheritance on `Extensible` in many classes, and removed it from `angel_route`.
Now, only `Angel` and `RequestContext` have `@proxy` annotations.
* Deprecated passing `debug` to Angel.
* `_LockableBytesBuilder` now uses `Uint8List`.
* Removed `reopen` from `ResponseContext`.

# 1.0.7+2
Changed `ResponseContext.serialize`. The `contentType` is now set *before* serialization.

# 1.0.7+1
Moved the `Model` class into `package:angel_model`. No functionality was added or removed.

# 1.0.7
Added an `accepts` method to `RequestContext`. It's now a lot easier to tell which content types the
user accepts via the `Accept` header.
